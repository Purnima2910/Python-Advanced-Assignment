    "# Q1. What is the relationship between classes and modules?\n",
    "\n",
    "## A module in Python is a single file that contains Python code.\n",
    "## It can define functions, classes, and variables, and can be imported into other Python files or scripts to be used.\n",
    "## To create a module, simply create a new .py file and write your Python code inside it. You can then import the module into other files using the import statement. \n",
    "##  For example, if you have a module named “mymodule.py”, you can import it into another file using the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "###  import mymodule\n",
    "\n",
    "## Once the module is imported, you can access its functions, classes, and variables using the dot notation. \n",
    "## For example, if the module “mymodule.py” defines a function named “myfunction()”, you can call that function using the following code: mymodule.myfunction()\n",
    "\n",
    "## A class is a blueprint for creating objects (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), and implementations of behavior (member functions or methods).\n",
    "\n",
    "## The class is defined using the “class” keyword, followed by the name of the class. The class definition usually contains a number of class variables and class methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A class variable is a variable that is shared by all instances of a class. Class variables are defined within the class but outside of any of the class’s methods."
